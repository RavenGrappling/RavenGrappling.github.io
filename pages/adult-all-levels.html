        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Inclusive Learning Environment:</strong>
          Our All-levels class caters to beginners and experienced practitioners alike, allowing everyone to learn at their own pace. Beginners will develop a solid foundation of techniques and concepts, while advanced students can continue to improve their skills, explore complex strategies, as well as mentor others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Safety and Respect:</strong>
          This class is all about upholding a safe training environment. Instructors will establish guidelines for respectful interaction and injury prevention, encouraging students to communicate openly about comfort levels during sparring.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Positional Sparring:</strong>
          This class includes a time for positional sparring, where you and your partner start in specific positions to practice techniques that you have learned in that class, in a live setting. This will help you apply what you've learned and adapt to real-time scenarios, without the full intensity of a rolling session.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Free Sparring:</strong>
          During the last rounds of the class, students are encouraged to engage in free sparring, where they get the opportunity to test their skills that they know against different partners. This is an important part of BJJ that allows you to see how your knowledge of techniques, strategies, and movements can overcome other experienced practitioners.
