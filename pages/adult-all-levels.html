        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Inclusive Learning Environment:</strong>
          Our All-levels class caters to beginner and experienced students, allowing everyone to learn at their own pace. Beginners will develop a solid foundation of techniques and concepts, while experianced students will improve their skills, explore complex strategies, as well as mentor others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Safety and Respect:</strong>
          This class is all about upholding a safe training environment. Instructors will set clear guidelines and expectations for respectful practice and injury prevention, encouraging students to communicate about comfort levels during sparring.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Positional Sparring:</strong>
          This class includes a time for positional sparring, where you and your partner start in specific positions to practice techniques that you have learned in that class. This helps everyone apply what they have learned and adapt to a partner that is provinding moderate resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Free Sparring:</strong>
          During the last rounds of the class, students are encouraged to engage in free sparring, where they get the opportunity to test their skill against different training partners. This is an important part of BJJ as it allows you to see how your knowledge of techniques, strategies, and movements can overcome other experienced practitioners.
