      About Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)
    </h2>  
    <h3>
      What makes Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) special when compared to many other martial arts?
    </h3>
    <p>
      BJJ is one of the very few martial arts that has been proven to be effective in real-life situations. It teaches how to overcome bigger and stronger opponents using techniques that actually work!
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt">
      I'm a woman, is BJJ a good fit for me?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Absolutely!</strong> BJJ is the single most effective martial art for women to learn. It will teach you practical self-defence techniques that will empower you to be more confident and resilient.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Is there kicking and/or punching in BJJ?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>No.</strong> BJJ is a grappling-based martial art that teaches how to deescalate an altercation by using techniques that allow for control and escapes, without the need to hurt your opponent.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Do you teach takedowns at your school?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Yes.</strong> Everyone in both the Kids/Teens as well as the Adult Programs gets to learn how to take the fight to the ground as well as how to prevent being taken down, using both wrestling and Judo techniques.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What does Gi & No-Gi mean?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gi is the traditional uniform, which consists of a jacket, pants and a ranked belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      No-Gi is when you wear regular exercise clothes such as a rashguard/t-shirt and shorts, but without a ranked belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to practicing BJJ, the fundamental movements generally the same for both. However, the amount of techniques and the way they are performed can have different variations.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What are the ranks in BJJ?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The kids/teens ranks (ages 4-15), and their primary colours are: White -> Grey -> Yellow -> Orange -> Green
    </p>
    <p>
      The adults ranks are (ages 16+) and their primary colours are: White -> Blue -> Purple -> Brown -> Black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, each belt colour generally requires 4 stripes to progress to the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time you spend at each rank will depend on your level of commitment and proficiency of the martial art.
    </p>
