      About BJJ
   </h1>
   <h3>
      What makes Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) special compared to other martial arts?
   </h3>
   <p class="squished">
      BJJ is one of the only martial arts to be proven to be effective in real-life situations, because it teaches how to overcome bigger and stronger opponents using techniques that actually work!
   </p>
   <p class="squished">
      It's also perfect fit for women, children and anyone else looking to start their martial arts journey, as classes are always focused at providing an engaging, safe, and welcoming atmosphere.
   </p>

   <h3 class="mt">
      I'm a woman, is BJJ a good fit for me?
   </h3>
   <p class="squished">
      Absolutely! BJJ is the single most effective martial art for women to learn. It will teach you self-defence techniques in a way that empowers you to be in control, so that you can gain the confidence in your ability to protect yourself.
   </p>
   <h3>
      Is there kicking and/or punching in BJJ?
   </h3>
   <p class="squished">
      No. BJJ is a grappling-based martial art that teaches how to use techniques that allow to either control or escapse the fight/situation, without needing to use additional force (submissions) unless given no other choice.
   </p>
   <h3>
      Do you learn how to takedowns at your school?
   </h3>
   <p class="squished">
      Yes. Everyone in both the Kids/Teens and Adult Programs will learn how to take people down, using both wrestling and Judo techniques.
   </p>
   <h3>
      What is Gi & No-Gi?
   </h3>
   <p class="squished">
      Gi is when you wear the traditional uniform, which consists of a jacket, pants and a ranked belt.
   </p>
   <p class="squished">
      No-Gi is when you wear a rashguard/t-shirt and shorts, without a belt showing a rank.
   </p>
   <p class="squished">
      When it comes to practice, the fundamental movements are the same for both. However, the amount of techniques and the way they are performed can have different variations.
   </p>
   <h3>
      What are the ranks in BJJ?
   </h3>
   <p class="squished">
      The kids/teens ranks (4-15), and their primary colours are: White -> Grey -> Yellow -> Orange -> Green
   </p>
   <p class="squished">
      The adults ranks are (16+): White -> Blue -> Purple -> Brown -> Black.
   </p>
   <p class="squished">
      Additionally, each belt colour generally requires 4 stripes to progress to the next one.
   </p>
   <p class="squished">
      The time you spend at each belt rank will primarly depend on your level commitment and understanding of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
   </p>
   <h3>
      How long are your classes?
   </h3>

   </p>
   <p class="squished">
