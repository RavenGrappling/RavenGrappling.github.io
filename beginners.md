    Program description
  </h3>
  <p>
    The fundamental program has been carefully designed to provide students with a welcoming and nurturing learning environment. Emphasis is always placed on safety, so that all students can benefit from learning at their own pace and comfort level.
  </p>
  <p>
    To guide students in their learning, the fundamental program follows a set curriculum that introduces beginners to 4 core positions of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Students will be immersed in each position for 2 weeks, before transitioning to the next. With this model of teaching, the fundamental program can be fully explored by a student every 2 months. The goal is to make sure that each position can be revisited frequently, so that students can better retain what they learned on previous rotations, both as theory and practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    When fully committed, and with regular attendance, students can expect to see improvements in their confidence, fitness as well as proficiency in the art.
