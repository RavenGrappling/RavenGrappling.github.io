  <p>
    Raven Grappling is a modern Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school, located in Coquitlam, that prides itself on making this martial art accessible and safe for everyone. We are also proudly associated with Subconscious Jiu Jitsu, under the direct guidance of Professor Nicholas Gregoriades and Professor Brent Burniston, who have become instrumental mentors to the growth of the school as well as its students.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Raven Grappling, students can expect a relaxed yet professional training environment. We take great pride in preparing daily lessons and curriculum to ensure that individual growth is always progressing. Our goal is to simplify the complexity of this martial art, so that students have a clear path in terms of their individual skill development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, as much as we recognize the value of a competitive environment, we equally preserve a training space where students can be as casual as they like. Because of this, students can always rely on our ongoing determination to keep them safe, regardless of their skill level or ability.

    In all, students and visitors alike, can count on being well treated and welcomed, regardless of training background or affiliation.

        Owner & Head Instructor
      </h4>
      <p>
        Dmytro has been practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu since he was only 15 years old. Unlike most students today, his first exposure was through the practice of MMA, as there were only a small number of schools that specialized in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first several years, Dmytro was primarily focused on No-Gi grappling, but as the sport began to evolve and grow in popularity, he then had an opportunity to fully commit himself to learn from instructors that specialized in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the opening of Raven Grappling, Dmytro continues stive to better himself as an instructor, practitioner and owner, under the direct guidance of Professor Brent Burniston and Professor Nicholas Gregoriades of Subconscious Jiu Jitsu Association, whose HQ is located in California, US. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As his journey in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu continues, Dmytro is passionate about sharing all that he has learned from over a decade of experience in competitive and self-defense oriented styles. He is committed in bringing a depth of practical knowledge to his students, whether they have casual or competitive aspirations.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Yoko first became introduced to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2015 and has been immersed in it ever since. When she first started, Yoko was of a smaller stature than her other training partners and often felt intimidated by their size and strength difference. However, she quickly realized that the techniques that she was learning provided her with the knowledge as well as ability to defend herself against larger opponents, in safe and practical way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to the present, Yoko’s ongoing commitment to BJJ has transformed her into a very skilled and knowledgeable grappler. This is most exemplified by her recent major accomplishment, which was winning the 2022 IBJJF Master Words - an incredible testament to her hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from her invaluable expertise on the mats, Yoko is also an amazing coach and mentor to both advanced students and those who are just starting their journey in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
