      </h4>
      <p>
        A black belt under Brent Burniston & Nic Gregoriades, Dmytro has been practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu since he was only 15 years old. Unlike most students today, his first exposure to this martial art was through the practice of MMA, as there were only a small number of schools that offered Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first several years, Dmytro was primarily focused on No-Gi grappling, but as the sport began to evolve and grow in popularity, he then had an opportunity to fully commit himself and specialize in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the opening of Raven Grappling, Dmytro continues strive to better himself as an instructor, practitioner and owner, under the direct guidance of Professor Brent Burniston and Professor Nicholas Gregoriades, of Subconscious Jiu Jitsu Association. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As his journey in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu carries on, Dmytro is passionate about sharing all that he has learned from close to 2 decades of experience, in both competitive and self-defense oriented styles. He is committed in bringing a depth of practical knowledge to his students, whether they have casual or competitive aspirations.
