    Program description
  </h3>
  <p>
    This class is designed to provide students with time for self-learning & the opportunity to practice what they had learned in class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Students and visitors alike are also able to use this training session to learn new techniques as well as do some live or positional sparring. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For safety purposes, students who are yet to transition from the Beginner program will only be allowed to do positional sparring, so that potential risk of injury is avoided.
