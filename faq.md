          What makes Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) special compared to other martial arts?

          <p>
            BJJ is one of the best martial arts to learn for self-defence, because it teaches you how to overcome bigger and stronger opponents using techniques that actually work! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other martial arts, BJJ does not encourage the escalation of force/violence, unless it is absolutely necessary. Instead, you learn how to keep yourself 
            safe while controlling the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this mindset, BJJ is a great martial art to involve your children, since it will teach them to become confident in themselves and keep the bullies away.

            The adults ranks are reserved for ages (16+): White -> Blue -> Purple -> Brown -> Black.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kids/teens ranks are reserved for ages (4-15) and the primary colours are: White -> Grey -> Yellow -> Orange -> Green
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, each belt colour generally requires 4 stripes to progress to the next one.

          What is the difference between Gi & No-Gi?

            Gi or commonly referred to as Kimono, is when you wear the traditional uniform, which consists of a jacket, pants and a ranked belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            No-Gi is when a practitioner wears a rashguard/t-shirt and shorts, without a belt showing their rank.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to practice, the fundamental movements are the same for both. However, the amount of techniques and the way they are performed can differ from Gi and No-Gi.

            No. As much as we value competition, we understand that most of our students are doing BJJ as a fun and enjoyable activity. 
            However, if a student is interested in testing their skills through competition, we will help them prepare.
