        What makes Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) special compared to other martial arts?

        BJJ is one of the best martial arts to learn for self-defence, because it teaches you how to overcome bigger and stronger opponents using techniques that actually work! 
        
Unlike other martial arts, BJJ does not encourage the escalation of force/violence, unless it is absolutely necessary. Instead, you learn how to keep yourself safe while controlling the situation.

Because of this mindset, BJJ is a great martial art to involve your children, since it will teach them to become confident in themselves and keep the bullies away.

       The adults ranks are reserved for ages (16+): White --> Blue --> Purple --> Brown --> Black. 

The kids/teens ranks are reserved for ages (4-15) and the primary colours are: White --> Grey -->  Yellow --> Orange --> Green

Each belt colour also generally requires 4 stripes to progress to the next one.

        Gi or commonly referred to as Kimono, is when you are wearing the traditional uniform, which consists of jacket, pants and a ranked belt. 
        No-Gi is when a practitioner wears a rashguard/t-shirt and shorts, without a belt showing their rank.
        When it comes to practice, the fundamental movements are the same for both. However, the amount of techniques and they way they are performed can differ from Gi and No-Gi.
