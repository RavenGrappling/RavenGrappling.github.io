            BJJ is one of the only martial arts to be proven to be effective in real-life situations, because it teaches how to overcome bigger and stronger opponents using techniques that actually work! 
          </p>
          <p>
          It's also perfect fit for women, children and anyone else looking to start their martial arts journey, as classes are always focused at providing an engaging, safe, and welcoming atmosphere.

            Absolutely! BJJ is the single most effective martial art for women to learn. It will teach you self-defence techniques in a way that empowers you to be in control, so that you can gain the confidence in your ability to protect yourself.

          <p>
            No. BJJ is a grappling-based martial art that teaches how to use techniques that allow to either control or escapse the fight/situation, without needing to use additional force (submissions) unless given no other choice.

            Yes. Everyone in both the Kids/Teens and Adult Programs will learn how to take people down, using both wrestling and Judo techniques.

            Gi is when you wear the traditional uniform, which consists of a jacket, pants and a ranked belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            No-Gi is when you wear a rashguard/t-shirt and shorts, without a belt showing a rank.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to practice, the fundamental movements are the same for both. However, the amount of techniques and the way they are performed can have different variations.

            The kids/teens ranks (4-15), and their primary colours are: White -> Grey -> Yellow -> Orange -> Green
          </p>
          <p>
            The adults ranks are (16+): White -> Blue -> Purple -> Brown -> Black.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, each belt colour generally requires 4 stripes to progress to the next one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time you spend at each belt rank will primarly depend on your level commitment and understanding of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

            When doing any physical activity, there is a chance that you might get a few bumps and bruises. 
            However, at our gym, we always make sure that your safety is our top priority, so that serious injuries do not happen. We take extra care in keeping everyone safe by providing clear instructions and discouraging any aggressive/uncontrolled behaviour. You can rest assured that we will do everything we can for you to feel safe and taken care of.
