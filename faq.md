          <p>
            BJJ is one of the best martial arts for self-defence, because it teaches you how to overcome bigger and stronger opponents using techniques that actually work! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, unlike other martial arts, BJJ does not encourage escalation of force/violence, unless it is absolutely necessary. Instead, you learn how to keep yourself 
            safe, while being in control of the situation.

            The adults ranks are (16+): White -> Blue -> Purple -> Brown -> Black.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kids/teens ranks (4-15), and their primary colours are: White -> Grey -> Yellow -> Orange -> Green
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, each belt colour generally requires 4 stripes to progress to the next one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time you spend on each belt will depend on your level commitment and understanding of the martial art.

          What is the difference between Gi & No-Gi?

            Gi or commonly referred to as Kimono, is when you wear the traditional uniform, which consists of a jacket, pants and a ranked belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            No-Gi is when a practitioner wears a rashguard/t-shirt and shorts, without a belt showing their rank.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to practice, the fundamental movements are the same for both. However, the amount of techniques and the way they are performed can differ from Gi and No-Gi.
