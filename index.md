  <p>
    Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art that teaches both practical self-defence as well as sportive applications. Students will learn how to efficiently overcome larger and stronger opponents, through the use of techniques that allow for control, escapes, and submissions. BJJ is suitable for people from all ages and fitness levels. It is a highly adaptable martial art that can be modified to suit the needs and abilities of individual practitioners.
